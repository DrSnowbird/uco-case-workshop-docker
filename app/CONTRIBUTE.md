## Initial setup of this repository on static-resources file server

Instructions within the section headed "Dumb HTTP" on [this page](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-The-Protocols) need to be followed.

In particular, `hooks/post-update` needs to be provisioned as described, and a single Git push (via SSH) must be made after it is provisioned.
